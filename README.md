I am moving beyond writing simple neural networks and architectures. Spent my entire high school, writing ordinary neural networks and playing with different libraries. Now, I want to challenge myself and write more constructive code and go through research papers in a academic fashion. 


I have read till now about 300 research papers in Artificial Intelligence but they all were an impulsive read. Which is why, I have created this repository to archive and document paper by paper that I find fundamental and significant for both academic & research artificial intelligence. 

this repository conatins paper link & code that I read and implement from scratch. the notebooks and code are a mixture of mine and others. it is for personal study but if you want to star it feel free and if you have questions, simply create an **issue** on this repo and I will try to reach out to you. 

###### Repository is updated in bi-weekly fashion
