###### Moving beyond ordinary. Quite recently, I started to apply for fellowships and internships and found out, showcasing my talents and programming skills is very much necessary to get selected. 

I have finished my high school and am currently taking a gap year, while parallel being an AI researcher at Harvard University. I have read around 300 research papers in the span of 3+ years in Artificial Intelligence. Entire high school was spent reading papers and implementing intermediate projects in ai. Now, I am moving towards a more solid foundation and advanced AI literature and projects. 

This repository is a personal archive and reference, where I list all the interesting papers that I assume are fundamental, important and significant in artificial intelligence. Most of the papers and code I commit in this repository are a mix of mine aka original work and inspired work of others. 

The range of difficulty is from intermediate to advanced/very foundational. For undergrad students, some of the papers and code might come as hard but master’s and phd students should be able to grasp the concepts. I won’t indulge much into mathematics unless I really have to since writing about maths takes a huge amount of time. 


##### Explicit note:

I am not diving into any hype i.e. LLMs, Lora or something. They’re good advancements but way too much hype and unnecessary.The repository is written with the view to be as much constructive and deep as possible which moves beyond hype. 

##### Branch Explanation

` master - this branch consists notebooks and code which are written by reading research papers`

` tensorflow - consists introduction to latest modules of tensorflow & explanation`

` pytorch - consists introduction to latest modules of pytorch & explanation`

` lect/notes - consists lectures & notes that I have read and studied of different top universities and academies`

` experimental - consists any fun project/experiments I did (no context provided) IT’S WILD-WEST`


 ##### Solving! 

If you encounter any problem or need clarification, please create an issue within the repo and I will try to help. 

##### Foolish assumptions!

I assume, if you star this repository, you already have a good knowledge in ai or you are willing to spend time reading papers and understand yourself the code since I am unable to provide any blog/readme for each paper I go through as it slows down learning for me. 

I strongly recommend using ChatGPT/Bard if you want clarification of a section of code or certain implementation of mine before even creating a github issue on this repo. 

Google! Google! Google! 

##### Contribution!

Please, feel free to contribute. Contribution from community & Open source teams is really really important. But, kindly clearly state your changes and contributions and state their reasoning behind why they should be in this repository. 

By the way, if you want to painstakingly write a maths explanation of ai, that we went through this repo to write in a blog, be my guest, haha! 

##### Finally! 

Take everything with valid criticism and be constructive. Repository is updated every week twice = )
